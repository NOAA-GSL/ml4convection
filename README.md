# ml4convection

ml4convection is an end-to-end library that uses U-nets, a type of machine learning, to predict the spatial coverage of thunderstorms (henceforth, "convection") from satellite data.  Inputs to the U-net are a time series of multispectral brightness-temperature maps from the Himawari-8 satellite.  Available spectral bands are band 8 (central wavelength of 6.25 $\mu$m), 9 (6.95 $\mu$m), 10 (7.35 $\mu$m), 11 (8.60 $\mu$m), 13 (10.45 $\mu$m), 14 (11.20 $\mu$m), and 16 (13.30 $\mu$m).  Labels are created by applying an echo-classification algorithm to reflectivity maps from four weather radars in Taiwan.  The echo-classification algorithm is a modified version of Storm-labeling in 3 Dimensions (SL3D); you can read about the original version [here]{https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0089.1} and all except one of the modifications [here]{https://doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-19-0372.1}.  Before the end of April 2021, we (Ryan Lagerquist, Jebb Stewart, Imme Ebert-Uphoff, and Christina Kumler) plan to submit a journal article on this work to *Monthly Weather Review*, titled "Using deep learning to nowcast the spatial coverage of convection from Himawari-8 satellite data".
